# Apple_stock_forecasting
This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting the closing prices of the Apple stock prices. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and historical stock data is fetched using the `yfinance` library. This is NOT an investment advice.
